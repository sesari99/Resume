      <h2 style="color: black;"class = "ProfileSectionSubtitle"> Bio </h2>
      <p1 style="color: black;"class = "ProfileSectionTbox"> Born in Indonesia, went to high school in Qatar, and now currently studying in University of Washington - Bothell with the aim of obtaining a Bachelor of Science
    in Computer Science and Software Engineering. During my time studying the field of Computer Science and Software Engineering for over 4 years, I have grown a passion
    for the technicalities in the software industry, such as programming and structuring softwares. Recently, I have also grown a passion for the functionalities in software industry,
    specifically as a QA Analyst, after an internship experience with Accenture on a Data Migration Project. As an academic, I have opened up myself to many experiences, such as participating in
    international competitions, being the co-creator and vice president of a local Red Cross Club, and the aforementioned internship experience. With these experiences, I managed to enforce my
    soft skills in leadership, negotiation, public speaking, and communication while expanding my technical skill set of approaching and visualizing big data. Currently I have a year left
    before I obtain my degree. Yet, I have yet to find a field or topic of work that would immerse me as much equally as I would be when crafting music and videos during my leisure.
    Thus, although my academic goal is to get a degree, my personal goal is to find opportunities in which I can experience the different aspects of the industry.

The program begins by parsing the op-code word of the instruction and then decides how many additional words of memory need to be read in order to complete the instruction. The result of the conversion is printed out as ASCII format, which is done by converting binary information to hex. The program accepts these opcodes as valid: NOP, MOVE, MOVEM, ADD, SUB, MULS, DIVU, LEA, AND, NOT, Bcc, JSR, RTS, AND BRA. The program accepts these effective addressing as valid: data register direct, address register indirect/direct, immediate addressing, pre/post increment addressing, and word/long addressing.</a></li>
