      <p1 style="color: black;"class = "ProfileSectionTbox"> Born in Indonesia, went to high school in Qatar, and now currently studying in University of Washington - Bothell with the aim of obtaining a Bachelor of Science
    in Computer Science and Software Engineering. During my time studying the field of Computer Science and Software Engineering for over 4 years, I have grown a passion
    for the technicalities in the software industry, such as programming and structuring softwares. Recently, I have also grown a passion for the functionalities in software industry,
    specifically as a QA Analyst, after an internship experience with Accenture on a Data Migration Project. As an academic, I have opened up myself to many experiences, such as participating in
    international competitions, being the co-creator and vice president of a local Red Cross Club, and the aforementioned internship experience. With these experiences, I managed to enforce my
    soft skills in leadership, negotiation, public speaking, and communication while expanding my technical skill set of approaching and visualizing big data. Currently I have a year left
    before I obtain my degree. Yet, I have yet to find a field or topic of work that would immerse me as much equally as I would be when crafting music and videos during my leisure.
    Thus, although my academic goal is to get a degree, my personal goal is to find opportunities in which I can experience the different aspects of the industry.
